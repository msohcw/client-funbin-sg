					<p class="generic-para">
						<span class = "emphasis">
							1. Who is eligible to participate in the Colour Splash Fun Bin Challenge?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						The Challenge is open to all students who are enrolled in a Primary School at the point of entry submission. Immediate family members of the volunteers and associates of Avelife are not eligible to participate in the Challenge. 
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							2. Can I  more than 1 Colour Splash Fun Bin template?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						Yes you can! A maximum of three entries per student is allowed, but any additional entries via multiple accounts will be considered void.

						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							3. What materials can be used during the design of the Colour Splash?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						Any design is allowed! You are not restricted to just colour pencils, crayons, or watercolours. You can even design the Colour Splash in 3D, let your creativity flow!
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							4. How do I enter into the competition?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						Download and print out the Colour Splash Fun Bin Challenge template from our website under the 'How to Enter' tab. Fill in your name, school and class, contact number and email into the template for us to keep in touch with you. Design and decorate your bin by 31st July 2014 and submit a clear photo to funbin.entries@avelife.org. Everything that is on the Colour Splash template must be visible during the submission. You only need to submit a photo of your Colour Splash design. 
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							5. Are there any design criteria involved with the submission of the template?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						Everything that appears on the template is up to your own imagination, creativity and liking but do bear in mind the judging criteria if you want to stand a chance to win! Judging criteria can be found on our website under 'Challenge' and they include elements of Innovation, Attractiveness and Relevance to Singapore. 
						<br /><br />
						
						<span class = "emphasis">
							6. Is there any application fee involved with the submission of the Colour Splash Fun Bin template?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						No fees or money is involved to participate in this challenge, so do invite all your friends and share your ideas and creativity on Singapore's bin designs!
						<br /><br />

						<span class = "emphasis">
							7. How will I be informed if I win the competition?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						All winners will be notified via phone or email to attend an award presentation ceremony on the 10th of August 2014.
						<br /><br />

						<!--<span class = "emphasis">-->
						<!--	8. What does "Popularity" in the judging criteria mean? How does it contribute?-->
						<!--</span>-->
						<!--<br /><br />-->
						<!--Popularity basically means the number of likes your Colour Splash Fun Bin template photo has gained up till 31st of July. Start a Facebook account and change the privacy settings to public. Upload the photos to your own Facebook and add these words (hashtags) #environment, #FUNBIN, #SG50 and #avelife! We will be able to see the photo and check how many likes the photo has gained!-->
						<!--<br /><br />-->
						
						<span class = "emphasis">
						8. If the original design template has been damaged, will I still be able to collect a prize?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
The judging will be based solely on the photo/scan ted to Avelife. As long as the photo is deserving of a prize, you will still be notified of your win. However, we want to encourage you to keep your original art work safe, at least for the duration of the Challenge, as we want to have the entries displayed at a public space for everyone to see!	
						<br /><br />

						<span class = "emphasis">
						9. Am I able to win a prize for each of my 3 entries?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
            Unfortunately, every single participant is only able to win not more than one prize for themselves, but the multiple entries do increase each person's chance of winning! So do submit more and stand a chance to win these attractive prizes! Only the final three entries as received will be taken into consideration for judging.
						<br /><br />

						<span class = "emphasis">
            10. What is the budding Fun Bin Designers prize listed on this website about?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
            It is a prize that rewards effort such as the amount of hard work and thought given into the designing of the respective Fun Bin entries! So do show your enthusiasm and you'll be rewarded with a little gift from us!
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
            11. What will happen to my entry after the challenge has ended?
            </span>
						<br /><br />
            Outstanding entries will be displayed at a public space in Queenstown for everyone to admire. On this end, we hope that all who participate in this competition will keep their entries in mint condition for the purpose that they may be displayed for every one else to admire.
						<br /><br />

						


						<!-- <span class = "emphasis">
							Eligibility
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							1. I am not a Singaporean citizen, but am I eligible to participate in this Design Challenge?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						Yes! As long as you have an idea for a FUN BIN and an interest to take part in this challenge, you can! There are 2 main categories, one for Secondary School students and the other is an open category where any individual or group (of up to four) is allowed to participate. Anyone can participate and contribute ideas of brilliance!
						<br /><br />
						This competition is open to the residents of Singapore, where all enrolled members of the team must have a residential address in Singapore. They must also be present at all milestone events in the competition process. There must be at least ONE Singaporean citizen in all applications.
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							2. Why are Secondary School students specifically highlighted to participate in this challenge?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						There is no better time to inculcate a sense of imagination as well as positive values into secondary school students of today who are equipped with creative and experimental minds. We believe strongly that the secondary schools serve as a microcosm for the real world, yet remain as environments where the freshest of ideas and the most creative minds can thrive! By highlighting this separate category, we want to encourage these budding designers and ideators to help us build a cleaner and greener Singapore.
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							3. If I have already submitted an application for the Secondary Category, could I also enter the same application into the Open Category?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						No, only one application per individual/group can be submitted towards Fun Bin Design Challenge.
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							Grant
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							4. What items will I be provided with for prototyping? And must I really use the bin that Avelife provides?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						If shortlisted, you will be provided with a standard bin of 460mm diameter and 1010mm height as well as funding of SGD100 for those in the Secondary Category and SGD200 for those in the Open Category. Yes, it is mandatory to design around the bin that we provide for the one reason of usability. The purpose of this design challenge is to encourage modifications to existing infrastructure, which in this case are the bins we see on our streets and lift lobbies, and one of the main goals of the competition is to retrofit the current bins with new ideas and add ons to relieve the littering problem in Singapore.
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							5. Is there an application fee associated with this challenge?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						No application fee is required to participate! So do come with all your imagination and apply for the Fun Bin Design Challenge now!
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							6. If I am shortlisted to build the prototype, am I able to obtain the grant before I proceed with the prototyping?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						The grant will be disbursed only upon proper receipts by the end of the challenge for both the 'Secondary Schools Category' and the 'Open Category'. Do note that the prototyping grant is used to cover only expenses directly incurred for the production of the bin prototype, such as the tools and materials used in the building of it. Non-supportables will include any costs that are logistical in nature, such as manpower and transportation. Instructions will also be sent out at a later date to the finalists into the challenge. Please contact Avelife at funbin.info@avelife.org for greater clarifications if need be.
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							Bins and design
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							7. What kind of bin designs will be encouraged?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						We are looking for everything under the sun and anything creative! In fact, we encourage entries to go beyond the painting of the bin peripherals, such as to include cool gadgets, devices and mechanisms that could make the whole binning experience fun and memorable!
						<br /><br />
						The littering issue that Singapore faces runs deeper beyond the surface issues - passive litter, cigarette butt litter, high-rise litter, marine litter, etc. Instead, we want FBDC to be your platform to rethink the motivations and reasons behind why people litter, and use creative bin designs to target the heart of the issue and prevent littering. We do know that the following, will NOT be supported:
						<br /><br />
						a. Any design that has the potential to create misunderstandings in our multi-cultural and multi-religious society
						<br />
						b. Any design that is politically-themed
						<br />
						c. Any design that advocates lifestyles or has content that may be deemed as objectionable by the public.
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							8. What happens to my bin prototype after the competition ends? Can I keep it?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						The purpose of FBDC is the creation of fresh perspectives and good ideas about targeting the issue of littering, from Singaporeans to Singaporeans. Post-competition, there is a good chance that your bin will be taken up and placed in a public location, used by fellow Singaporeans!
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							Others
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
							9. I am a secondary school student participating in this challenge, will I be awarded Community Involvement Program points for it?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						What we can tell you is that, if shortlisted, this project definitely has a community element involved, through the usage of your bins. However, this ultimately depends on your school policy and you would have to check with your teacher-in-charge about this.
