						<span class = "emphasis">
						Eligibility
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
						1. I am not a Singaporean citizen, but am I eligible to participate in this Design Challenge?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						Yes! As long as you have an idea for a FUN BIN and an interest to take part in this challenge, you can! There are 2 main categories, one for Secondary School students and the other is an open category where any individual or group (of up to four) is allowed to participate. Anyone can participate and contribute ideas of brilliance! 
						<br /><br />
						This competition is open to the residents of Singapore, where all enrolled members of the team must have a residential address in Singapore. They must also be present at all milestone events in the competition process. There must be at least ONE Singaporean citizen in all applications.
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
						2. Why are Secondary School students specifically highlighted to participate in this challenge?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						There is no better time to inculcate a sense of imagination as well as positive values into secondary school students of today who are equipped with creative and experimental minds. We believe strongly that the secondary schools serve as a microcosm for the real world, yet remain as environments where the freshest of ideas and the most creative minds can thrive! By highlighting this separate category, we want to encourage these budding designers and ideators to help us build a cleaner and greener Singapore.
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
						3. If I have already submitted an application for the Secondary Category, could I also enter the same application into the Open Category?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						No, only one application per individual/group can be submitted towards Fun Bin Design Challenge.
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
						Grant
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
						4. What items will I be provided with for prototyping? And must I really use the bin that Avelife provides? 
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						If shortlisted, you will be provided with a standard bin of 460mm diameter and 1010mm height as well as funding of SGD100 for those in the Secondary Category and SGD200 for those in the Open Category. Yes, it is mandatory to design around the bin that we provide for the one reason of usability. The purpose of this design challenge is to encourage modifications to existing infrastructure, which in this case are the bins we see on our streets and lift lobbies, and one of the main goals of the competition is to retrofit the current bins with new ideas and add ons to relieve the littering problem in Singapore. 
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
						5. Is there an application fee associated with this challenge?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						No application fee is required to participate! So do come with all your imagination and apply for the Fun Bin Design Challenge now!
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
						6. If I am shortlisted to build the prototype, am I able to obtain the grant before I proceed with the prototyping?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						The grant will be disbursed only upon proper receipts by the end of the challenge for both the 'Secondary Schools Category' and the 'Open Category'. Do note that the prototyping grant is used to cover only expenses directly incurred for the production of the bin prototype, such as the tools and materials used in the building of it. Non-supportables will include any costs that are logistical in nature, such as manpower and transportation. Instructions will also be sent out at a later date to the finalists into the challenge. Please contact Avelife at funbin.info@avelife.org for greater clarifications if need be. 
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
						Bins and design
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
						7. What kind of bin designs will be encouraged?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						We are looking for everything under the sun and anything creative! In fact, we encourage entries to go beyond the painting of the bin peripherals, such as to include cool gadgets, devices and mechanisms that could make the whole binning experience fun and memorable! 
						<br /><br />
						The littering issue that Singapore faces runs deeper beyond the surface issues - passive litter, cigarette butt litter, high-rise litter, marine litter, etc. Instead, we want FBDC to be your platform to rethink the motivations and reasons behind why people litter, and use creative bin designs to target the heart of the issue and prevent littering. We do know that the following, will NOT be supported: 
						<br /><br />
						a. Any design that has the potential to create misunderstandings in our multi-cultural and multi-religious society
						<br />
						b. Any design that is politically-themed
						<br />
						c. Any design that advocates lifestyles or has content that may be deemed as objectionable by the public.
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
						8. What happens to my bin prototype after the competition ends? Can I keep it?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						The purpose of FBDC is the creation of fresh perspectives and good ideas about targeting the issue of littering, from Singaporeans to Singaporeans. Post-competition, there is a good chance that your bin will be taken up and placed in a public location, used by fellow Singaporeans!
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
						Others
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						<span class = "emphasis">
						9. I am a secondary school student participating in this challenge, will I be awarded Community Involvement Program points for it?
						</span>
						<br /><br />
						What we can tell you is that, if shortlisted, this project definitely has a community element involved, through the usage of your bins. However, this ultimately depends on your school policy and you would have to check with your teacher-in-charge about this.
