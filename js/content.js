		"title" : "Tissue Papers",
		"para" : "They can look like adorable paper planes in the wind, but not when they litter the pavements and ground we walk on. Tissue paper, almost used everywhere in our daily lives, can also be unhygienic and might cause the transmission of bacteria and viruses. Can we bear to see them at the soles of our feet, or our curious neighborhood cats sniffing at them?"

		"para" : "These culprits are so easily forgotten, and that makes them a huge problem. Despite their small size, the residue in cigarette filters can be so damaging to the environment, not forgetting how incompletely extinguished cigarette butts can start fires if thrown away indiscriminately. <br /><br />Did you know: cigarette contains hundreds of additives, of which thousands more are created when they are burnt. Some of these chemical compounds are toxic to the environment or even cancer-causing and might leech into Singapore's groundwater when these cigarette butts are washed by rain or thrown into drains and waterways."

	"plasticbag" : {
		"title" : "Plastic Bags",
		"para" : "One of the most common types of litter around, plastic bags are convenient for one time use, and often easily 'gone with the wind' since they are lightweight in nature. They easily land up in our waterways and storm drains, where they clog up drainage or get washed into the sea. Money is spent every year removing these debris from rainage areas and prevent them from becoming mosquito breeding sites. Coastal eco-systems are also affected as marine life may die from eating these plastic bags. Moreover, plastics don't degrade easily. Instead, they break up into smaller and smaller pieces. These tiny pieces are eventually eaten by small sea creatures and thus enter the food chain including seafood, which we consume!<br /><br />For a population of five million people, Singapore uses a staggering amount of three billion plastic bags a year! <br /><br />Reuse them if you can, but if you can't, then let's design a bin that helps people to bin these bags responsibly!"

	"container" : {
		"title" : "Food Containers",
		"para" : "The food packaging containers that we see are rarely ever new, often they were once held in our hands, containing many delicacies we love. Styrofoam and plastic are the nemeses of the environment, they take years and decades and centuries to break down,and attract pests like rats, flies and cockroaches that can make us sick! Also, due to their shape, they can collect rainwater that will end up being breeding grounds for mosquitoes that transmit diseases like dengue fever."
